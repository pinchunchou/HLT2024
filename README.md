# HLT2024

HLT photon and electron trigger studies for 2024 Run 3.

Currently we have the following codes:
1. `include` contains all the necessary shared header files
2. HLT turn-on curves for photons and electrons, 2024 run 3 pp ref MC.
3. HLT trigger rate studies for photons and electrons, 2024 run 3 pp ref MC.

To-do list:
1. Codes for 2024 run 3 PbPb.
2. Backward checks for 2023 run 3 PbPb MC and data.
3. Codes for 2024 run 3 data, PbPb and pp ref.
